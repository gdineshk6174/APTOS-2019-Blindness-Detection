Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more.<br>
Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Retinal (fundus) photography with manual interpretation is a widely accepted screening tool for diabetic retinopathy, with performance that can exceed that of in-person dilated eye examinations.<br><br>
